## Hello there 👋

I'm Mateus Gabriel - a developer passionate about IT projects and software development. 

I also love playing video-games and diving into sci-fi books (though physics books are even better!).

Here you will find everything about me and my career. I'm constantly improving my skills or building new projects to become a better developer, day by day. Hope you enjoy the journey! 

> Just a heads-up: most of my repositories and comments are in English, but you might find a few in Portuguese (PT-BR) - I'm Brazilian, after all! :brazil:
